## Scrabble is with unclear rules, not a fair game. 

This app fixes uncomfortable family discussions by providing:
 - a timer for each move, such that no one spends ages thinking
 - a scoring system
 - an implemtation the penalty challenge rule

*In penalty challenge (also known as modified single challenge, 5-point challenge, or 10-point challenge), a fixed number of points for the penalty is agreed on before the game, either by the two players or more often in tournament play, by the director(s). If a player challenges his/her opponent's play and it is invalid, the letters are taken back as usual and the opponent loses her/his turn. However, if the word is valid, the word remains on the board and the challenger loses 5, 10 or however many points the agreed penalty was. This can either be given to the opponent or subtracted from the challenger's score, depending on the agreed rules.*
